## 📱 Features

- Three screens implemented:

  - **Landing Screen**: This is the initial screen. Pressing the **Get Started** button navigates to the Home Page.
  - **Home Page**: Currently a placeholder screen. Includes a button to navigate to the Daily Reflection page.
  - **Discover Page**: Implemented as part of the second page in the task.
  - **Daily Reflection Page**: Accessible from the Home Page via a text button.

## 🧠 Assumptions

- All logic and data are stubbed, focusing only on UI.
